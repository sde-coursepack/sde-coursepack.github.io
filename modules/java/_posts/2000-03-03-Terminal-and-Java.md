Until now, you have likely used an IDE, like Eclipse
or IntelliJ, to handle compiling. And *most of the time*
this is exactly what you will do. However, I often find
students who think Eclipse/IntelliJ *is* Java, or that you have
to have an IDE to compile code. And this isn't correct!

Think of the IDE like AAA. If you have a flat tire, AAA 
will send a truck out to change your tire. However, it's 
also worth learning how to change a tire yourself. In 
that same way, let's look at how to change a Java tire.

## Terminal/Powershell

First, we need to become familiar with a very important
tool: terminal (or on Windows, Powershell[^1]). IntelliJ, 
the recommended Java IDE for the course, has a built-in
terminal. 

If you are
already comfortable using a command line terminal, then
you can skip this section. 

Often times, it can be easier/more efficient in terms of
developer time to use basic command line tools rather than
looking for a GUI (Graphical User Interface). 

While there are tons of commands out there, we're only
going to focus on two right now.

### ```ls```

```ls``` is a command for "long listing," or printing a list of the contents of the
directory you are currently in. For example, I have pictures
below from the [Prerequisite knowledge module](https://github.com/sde-coursepack/java-prerequisite)
open in Windows Powershell below:

<img alt="An image showing a terminal ls command show several folders and one file" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/blank_shell.png"/>

This means that in my terminal, I am currently in the folder:

```
C:\Users\pm8fc\SDE-Resources\example_code\StudentExample\src\main\java
```

I can list all of the files and directories in that folder using
the ```ls``` command.

<img alt="An image showing a terminal ls command show several folders and one file" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/ls.png"/>

### ```cd```

```cd``` stands for "change directory." Let's say I wanted
to look in the ```example``` sub-folder above. Well, I can
simply use the command:

```cd example```

to enter that directory. The below picture shows the ```cd```
command in the same folder as before, drilling down to the
```example``` folder. I then run an ```ls``` command to list the
directory contents.

<img alt="an ls in example showing 4 java files" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/cd.png"/>

It's worth noting that if you type ```cd ex``` and then hit
the ```Tab``` key, terminal will auto-complete ```example```
since that is the only folder that starts with ex. Getting
comfortable using Tab for autocompletion can improve your
speed and comfort with command line tools.

If you want to go "back up," such as going from ```example```
back to the parent folder ```java```, simply use:

```cd ..```

The ```..``` means "parent folder."

## Getting started with Java Commands

When you fully install Java to your computer, you can then use command-line Java
commands. The first command we always want to test is:

### java -version

In our command prompt, we want to type:

```java --version```

If we did this correctly, you should see something like:

<img alt="a terminal showing the version of java after a java -version command" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/version.png"/>

Note that you may have a different version of Java installed than me.
For this class, you are required to have Java 8 or later. It is highly
recommended to have Java version 17 or later.

**If you get an error message saying Java can't be found**, that means your Java is not installed
correctly. Either you have not [installed a Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), or you have
not correctly [added it to your **system path**](https://qualitestgroup.com/insights/technical-hub/how-to-add-java-to-your-system-path/).
The system PATH variable is used to list folders where you have installed
programs you want to use from command-line.

**If you have installed a newer version of Java, but are
still getting the older version number**, you either want
to check your [PATH variable](https://qualitestgroup.com/insights/technical-hub/how-to-add-java-to-your-system-path/)
**on Windows and Linux** and remove the folder for the older java installation from PATH, or
**on Mac**, [you will want to change your default JDK](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-C5F0BF25-3487-4F33-9275-7000C8E1C58C)
and/or [uninstall your older JDKs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-F9183C70-2E96-40F4-9104-F3814A5A331F)

### javac

The javac command (think "java compile") can be used to
compile a Java file into a .class file. For instance, I can
compile Student.java using the command:

```javac Student.java```

You can see the
before and after in the folder below when I compile
Student.java:

<img alt="A terminal window showing after I compile Student.java that there is now a class called Student.class" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/compile.png"/>

To be clear: **you will not have to compile java files this
way in class and during homework assignments.** My goal in showing
you this compilation is to show you *how your IDE works*, because
your IDE is running these commands for you in the background. Typically,
your IDE will put your .class files in a folder like ```build```, ```out```
, or ```bin``` depending on configuration. In this class, using
our build tool ```gradle```, which we will cover in the **Collaboration** unit,
your .class files will go in a folder ```build/classes```

Let's now try to compile ```Main.java```. We'll use ```javac Main.java``` and:

<img alt="When I try to compile Main.java, I get a compiler error saying Java can't identify a class called Student or Enrollment" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/compile_error.png"/>

The reason for this error is that the class Main has **dependencies** to the classes
Student and Enrollment. I therefore cannot compile Main.java with the simple command
above. I bolded the word **dependencies** there because that is a **very important word**
that I want you to file away for later. Dependencies are a critical concept
not just in compilation, but in design.

This didn't happen with Student.java, because Student.java doesn't
depend on any other classes in this folder.

To fix this, rather than compile all of these files one at a time, we can
compile all of these files together, and Java will be able to resolve the dependencies
during compile time.

```javac Main.java Enrollment.java Student.java StudentNameComparator.java```

<img alt="show the results of the above command, resulting in all 4 java files being compiled" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/compile_correct.png"/>

### Running .class file

Now that we have the .class files compiled, we can navigate to the 
parent folder (the one that contains the folder example)
and run our Main.class program with the following commands[^2]:

```cd .. ``` 

This command gets us into the folder that contains the "example" package.

```java example.Main```

<img alt="Showing the results of running example.Main, which is to print Hello World" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/run.png"/>


Note that we do *not* say "Main.class". The .class is assumed
by Java when looking for the class files. The reason for the ```example.```
before the class name is because in our Main.java is in a **package**
called ```example```. This is denoted in Main.java:

```java

package example;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ...
    }
}
```
The first line tells Java that this class is part of a package called
"example". We can think of this as "in a folder called example."

We will talk more about packages and why we want them later, but for now it's sufficient
to think that ```example.Main``` means "in the package example, run the class
Main."

### Hidden complexity

It's worth noting that running the class file in this way comes
with a lot of hidden complexity. First, all classes that Main depends
on, either directly like Enrollment and Student, or indirectly like StudentNameComparator,
must be in the same folder, or in the classpath (basically, the class libraries
that the JRE has access to). Additionally, there may be other libraries
beyond default Java libraries (like java.util and java.io) that we may rely on
if we were building a more complicated program. We will address these
complexities later, but the short version is to be thankful to your
IDE for handling all of this for you.

### .jar files

Another issue with the above code is that if we want to share the
executable program Main above, we would have to share all four classes.
Main.class is only the bytecode of Main.java, not the other three classes. We 
would then have to tell whoever we share the code with which .class file to run. 
This is a finicky approach that requires a lot of effort on the part of the end user.

Instead, wouldn't it be easier for them if we could send them one single file
that contains all of the classes they need, and they just run that?

This brings us to **jar files**. You can think of a .jar file kind of
like a .zip file: it bundles several files together into a single file.
In this case, we want to put all four of our class files from the example
into a single jar. However, unlike .zip files, we can run .jar files
as though they were a single Java class!

We can build a .jar file from command-line; however, this is going
to take a bit more work on our end than compiling a single java file.

From our "java" folder above (the folder that contains "example", 
where "example" has all of our .java and .class files), we can run:

```jar cf MyJar.jar example/*.class```

<img alt="Showing the command above which produces a file called MyJar.jar" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/jar.png"/>

This will create a jar file in our "java" folder called MyJar.jar,
and that file will contain all of our classes. *However*, when we try to
run the file with:

```java -jar MyJar.jar```

...which is the way we can run .jar files with the ```java``` command, 
we get an error:

<img alt="Showing an error when we try to run our .jar file which says no manifest found" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/jar_error.png"/>

The issue here is that while the .jar file does contain all
of our classes, we haven't told Java which file to run when we run the jar!
To fix this, we can add the "entry flag" to our command:

```jar cfe MyJar.jar example.Main example/*.class```

<img alt="Showing the result of the above more robust jar compiling command" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/4/jar_fixed.png"/>

In the above command, notice we added "e" to the argument after jar. This tells
the jar tool that we want to change the "entry point" (aka, "Main-Class") of our
jar. The argument "example.Main" tells the jar program which class to set as the
Main-Class. Note that the order of the arguments here are relevant, the first argument
is the name of the jar, the second argument is the Main-Class, and the third argument
is the classes to compile.

**Do not worry about memorizing all of these commands.** Your IDE is going to take
care of most of this. However, for the next unit, you should be comfortable with these
two basic commands:

```java mypackage.MyClass```

```java -jar MyJar.jar```

We will be using these to run programs with command-line arguments in the next unit.

However, for actually making jar files, we will eventually be using
a tool called ```gradle``` which we will cover later. This tool
will add a lot of simplicity to our *build process*.
