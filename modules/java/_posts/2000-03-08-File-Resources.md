# Resources in Java
{: .no_toc }

Often, our programs will need to use external resources. These could include:

* Files on our computer
* The Internet
* A Database
* etc.

In this module, we will first look at some simple usage of resource files in Java.

Second, we will look at some basic File I/O in Java for reading and writing to
Plain Text files (like .txt or .csv).

## Resource Files/Assets

Often, when making a program or website, we will need assets. These assets could
include images, like this picture of my cat Chloe sitting on my shoulder despite
my wishes that she not:

<img alt="The author's calico cat sitting on his shoulder, while the author scowls with annoyance, despite internally feeling loved like he has never felt before" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/8/chloe.jpg"/>

If I wanted to make this a company logo (and who wouldn't), then this image would
likely appear throughout any app I made. And so, I need to store that image with
the app's project code-base. And, in fact, the above picture [*is* in this website's
code base.](https://github.com/sde-coursepack/sde-coursepack.github.io/blob/main/modules/java/images/8/chloe.jpg)

Of course, this website is largely built from markdown files, not .java files. 
So the way I store and utilize the image in a Java project is a little different.

As we don't want to get into GUIs just yet, let's start simple.

### Creating a simple text file.

Let's make a simple text file in IntelliJ. I'm going to use my project
from the IntelliJ lecture.

First, I open up a text editor and write the file contents:

```
A Haiku for my cat:

Chloe, calico,
Why do you stand on shoulders?
I'm trying to work!
```

Now, wherever I saved that file, I'm going to copy and paste (or click and drag)
the file into my project's `src/main/resources` folder:

![haiku_resource.png](..%2Fimages%2F8%2Fhaiku_resource.png)

## Resource File Example Program

The following code is a complete program to open and read a resource file:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileResourceExample {
    private static final String RESOURCE_FILENAME = "chloe.txt";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileResourceExample example = new FileResourceExample();
        example.run();
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            InputStream inputStream = getResourceAsInputStream(RESOURCE_FILENAME);
            BufferedReader bufferedReader = getBufferedReaderForInputStream(inputStream);
            printBufferedReaderContents(bufferedReader);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    private InputStream getResourceAsInputStream(String resourceFilename) throws FileNotFoundException {
        ClassLoader loader = FileResourceExample.class.getClassLoader();
        InputStream stream = loader.getResourceAsStream(resourceFilename);
        if (stream == null) {
            throw new FileNotFoundException("Resource file: " + resourceFilename + " is not found.");
        }
        return stream;
    }

    private BufferedReader getBufferedReaderForInputStream(InputStream inputStream) {
        InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);
        return new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);
    }

    private void printBufferedReaderContents(BufferedReader bufferedReader) throws IOException {
        String currentLine = bufferedReader.readLine();
        while(currentLine != null) {
            System.out.println(currentLine);
            currentLine = bufferedReader.readLine();
        }
    }
}

```

Note that I broke up the above code into several functions so that we can focus on each step individually. It is not necessary to write this as several functions.


Now that we have this resource, we can access it using the following function:

```java
    private InputStream getResourceAsInputStream(String resourceFilename) throws FileNotFoundException {
        ClassLoader loader = FileResourceExample.class.getClassLoader();
        InputStream stream = loader.getResourceAsStream(resourceFilename);
        if (stream == null) {
            throw new FileNotFoundException("Resource file: " + resourceFilename + " is not found.");
        }
        return stream;
    }
```

Specifically, these lines here give us an `InputStream` that accesses the "haiku.txt" file (in this case, stored in the variable `resourceFilename`)

```java
    ClassLoader loader = FileResourceExample.class.getClassLoader();
    InputStream stream = loader.getResourceAsStream(resourceFilename);
```

You'll notice the filename is on the second line. We start by getting a `ClassLoader` - the ClassLoader is a way to load resources from our project, including our "haiku.txt" resource file. Using the `getResourceAsStream(resourceFilename)` function, we get an InputStream from our file. 

You'll notice we have some extra code here:

```java
    if (stream == null) {
        throw new FileNotFoundException("Resource file: " + resourceFilename + " was not found.");
    }
    return stream;
```

It's important to be aware that `getResourceAsStream` *does not throw `FileNotFoundException` if the resource file isn't found*. Rather, it simply returns a `null` InputStream. Personally, I think this is bad design, but nobody at Java asked me (which is probably a good idea). But this *does* mean you need to do a null check on your InputStream, or be prepared to handle a `NullPointerException`.

This gives us the String variable `inputStream` which we can then use to read via a `BufferedReader` as follows:

```java 
    private BufferedReader getBufferedReaderForInputStream(InputStream inputStream) {
        InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);
        return new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);
    }
```

Note that you may often see people combine these two lines:

```java
    return new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(filename));
```

However, we'll discuss later how this could be seen as bad style in many contexts because it makes the code harder to read and understand if you use this nested constructor call approach. That said, it's common enough for these "repetitive" file IO situations that we tend to overlook it.

Now, we can simply read the file via a BufferedReader. We cover reading from a BuffedReader below.


## Using a BufferedReader

A BufferedReader has one key method: `readLine()`

* This method returns a String of the next line in the file
* If the BufferedReader has reached the end of the file, it returns `null`

One simple use-case of a BufferedReader is to print the contents
of the file. One way to print the contents of a file is:

```java
    String currentLine = bufferedReader.readLine();
    while(currentLine != null) {
        System.out.println(currentLine);
        currentLine = bufferedReader.readLine();
    }
```

You may often see this using a `for` instead.

```java
    for (String line = bufferedReader.readLine(); line != null; line = bufferedReader.readLine()) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
```

I generally recommend using a `for` loop over a `while` loop whenever feasible, as it's much harder to accidentally create an infinite loop with a `for` loop.

Of course, you don't have to print. For example, if you are reading
a csv file, you may split the line into pieces by commas and use the file contents to create or populate a list of data structures. Or any number of other things you could do to parse a file.

## Files.lines()

Another approach for reading a file is to use `Files.lines()`, which is a functional programming approach. We will discuss this when going over functional programming and lambda bodies, later on. However, to show you what it would look like:

```java
        bufferedReader.lines()
            .forEach(line -> System.out.println(line));
```

## Main resources vs Test Resources

Remember that our source folder has both a `main` and `test` folder. In general,
any resources in `main` are accessible by either `main` or `test`. Resources in
`test` are only accessibly by classes in `test`.

For example, let's say you write a class that reads a CSV file and produces
an ArrayList of some class. You can include an example csv file in the 
`test` resources to test with, but that file won't be confused as part of the
`main` resources of the project.

When we discuss testing in that unit, it's worth noting that our test classes will be able to access both `test` and `main` resources, while our `main` classes will **not** be able to access `test` resources.

## User specified files shouldn't be resources

If your program can take in a filename from the user, such as via command-line, text entry, file browser window, etc., you should *never* read that file with `ClassLoader`. In that case, it's sufficient to just create a `BufferedReader` from the filename the user gives you.

Something like:

```java
    public ArrayList<String> getLinesFromFile(String filename) {
        try {
            FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(filename);
            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
            ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();
            String line = bufferedReader.readLine();
            while (line != null) {
                lines.add(line);
                line = bufferedReader.readLine();
            }
            return lines;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }

    }

```

You only use Resources when you are trying to access a resource file that you would include in a distribution of the project.

## Resource usage example

Consider the puzzle game [Picross S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph0ADToB-1c), which involves solving puzzles called [nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram). 

![img.png](../images/8/nonogram_example.png)
Image Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#/media/File:Nonogram_wiki.svg)

If you are a programmer of the game Picross S, which seems like the better approach for development?

1) Create a Java class for every single puzzle that describes how the puzzle works and hard-code what the data values are for each row/column 
2) Describe a generic puzzle class that works for all puzzles, and store the *data* of each row and column as a file.

Saw we wanted to implement 300 puzzles. In the first case, we would need at least 300 classes. In the second case, we'd need probably two classes (one to read in the file, and the other to model the state of the puzzle) and 300 resource files. These files might be formatted something like (using the puzzle above):

```text
width: 30
height: 20

rows:
8, 7, 5, 7
5, 4, 3, 3
3, 3, 2, 3
...

columns:
1
1
2
...

```

Again, this is hypothetical. (As a note, if I were implementing this, I would likely use something like JSON, rather than the text above, but that's beyond what we've covered so far). The point, however, is that this allows us to simply create 300 puzzle files with a consistent, human-readable format. This lets us separate *how the game works* from the individual puzzles in the game, and allows them to be edited separately from the source code.

## Conclusion

Resource files, such as images, configurations, data, etc. are a vital tool in software development. Learning how to store and utilize resource files appropriately is a skill worth learning. For with that skill, you can stand on mountaintops...
