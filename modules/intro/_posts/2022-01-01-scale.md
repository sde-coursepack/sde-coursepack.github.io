# Writing Code vs Solving Problems

If you're taking this class, you've likely been learning how to write code for a year or more. This means you are capable of writing simple scripts, and even smaller multi-class programs, especially in Java. This valuable skill is the bedrock on which to grow your skills.

However, the skill by itself is a tool that you know how to use. A master craftsperson must know how to use all kinds of tools. But knowing how to use a tool doesn't make one a master. Being a master of one's craft comes from the ability to combine these tools to create great works. A master craftsperson works efficiently and accurately, yes, but they also produce work that they take pride in.

In this class, I want to do more than code. I want to you to become a craftsperson, one who builds high quality work that will last. You won't attain mastery in one semester. But the goal of this course is to give you enough tools, techniques, and goals to start you on your journey.

## Large scale systems

<br>- __Hitchhiker's Guide to that Galaxy__, Douglas Adams

Your classroom experience in coding so far likely has not prepared you for writing *enterprise* systems. The word enterprise means "a project or undertaking, typically one that is difficult or requires effort." When we talk about *enterprise software*, we are talking about larger software systems. These systems are built and maintained by teams of programmers over a long period of time, and must respond to changing customer needs or environmental changes. 

Unfortunately, software problems can't be solved by just adding more people. Famously, [Brook's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law) states that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." Fred Brooks, the namesake of the law, notes that it takes time for even skilled programmers to become productive in a system. And that "ramp-up" time means time an experienced program is spending on training they otherwise could have spent developing code. Communication overhead is also a serious consideration; as the size of a team increases, the number of lines of commuication increase quadratically. Remember, increasing quadratically is why we don't bother with selction and insertion sort in most cases.

**This problem isn't unique to software!** Engineers of all stripes have to deal with these problems!

## Ad hoc solutions

Imagine a scenario: You are hiking with several small children. You come across a small creek in your path. You need to get children over the creek without their feet getting wet. What do you do?

Well, thinking quickly, you may see a log nearby, drag it over, and lay it across the creek, having kids walk over. After the kids are over, you may leave the log and walk away, never thinking of crossing that creek again.

This is an *ad hoc* solution: that is, a one-time solution to the problem. You had a short-term need, so you made a quick and easy solution to solve your immediate problem. You don't care about maintaining the solution, you don't care about other people being able to use the solution, you don't have a long term plan in place if the log rots, etc.

The thing is, most engineering problems aren't solved this way. But this is likely how you've been doing most homework so far! You build one assignment at a time, sometimes the day before it is due, you keep writing code until it works, and then as soon as it works you submit it and move on to something else. You may never even look at that code again! Obviously consumer software doesn't work this way.

## Increasing problem scale

Now imagine that instead of a small creek, you are crossing a large river. Instead of small children, you are transporting cars. And instead of crossing the river once, you need these cars to be able to go back and forth across this bridge for several decades. This means not just building the bridge, but establishing the process of *how* you are going to build the bridge, what is the budget of this bridge, how is this bridge going to be maintained, how are you going to monitor this bridge for faults, how will you ensure the bridge doesn't fail when a heavy truck drives over, etc. 

"Dragging over an even bigger log" isn't a solution.

The key takeaway is that small scale ad hoc problem solving is fundamentally different from building larger, sustainable systems. Building one-off throw away assignments in earlier programming classes does not teach you the critical skills needed.

Large software isn't built by one programmer working alone for one afternoon, or cramming at midnight before the due date, testing their code against a teacher provider auto-grader. In software, long-term projects built incrementally one step at a time are the norm.

## Goals of this course

In this course, we will start preparing you for writing and evolving larger software systems, practicing incremental development alongside other programmers.

In your future classes, you can expect to use these skills and with the section of this website that relates to it:
* "How are we going to share code?" - Collaboartion
* "How will we know if we're on the right track?" - Testing
* "How should be build this system?" - Arch
* "How can be break apart this system to implement piecewise?" - Design
* "Where is our data going to be stored between runs?" - Data

While this course teaches a grab-bag of different skills, these were not selected at random. At the end of this course, you should be ready to jump in to a larger project, and be able to build the system incrementally over time with your project teammates.
