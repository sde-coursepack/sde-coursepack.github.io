# Git Basics

In this unit, we will dive into specific usage of git. This is meant
to be a "getting started" tutorial. This will not cover all advanced
usage of git. However, there are a number of more robust tutorials
to be found online.

## Login/Permissions issues with GitHub

In this unit you will login to Github in IntelliJ. Typically, **you cannot use your GitHub password 
to login to GitHub** via a third party app.

If you are having any login issues, it's most likely that you are not logging in
with a personal access token.

Review the [documentation here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
for how to create a Personal Access Token.

When you need to select permissions, you should give the following:
- repo (which will check repo:status, repo_deployment, and public_repo)
- read:org (under admin:org)
- gist

Then, once you have the personal access token, you can use it as the password
in either IntelliJ or any other program that requests an email/password
to connect to your GitHub account.

## .gitignore

When we create a new project, one of the first files we want to
commit, even before we start writing code, is a .gitignore file.
A .gitignore file tells git which files *not* to commit relative
to its current location.

Consider the following example .gitignore

```gitignore
# Gradle related folders
build/
.gradle/

# Local settings files
gradle-app.setting
.settings/
.classpath
.idea/**/workspace.xml


# Ignore java compiled files
*.jar
*.class

# Don't ignore gradle wrapper jar
!gradle-wrapper.jar
```

This is an incomplete excerpt from this [.gitignore file](https://github.com/sde-coursepack/NBAExcelTeams/blob/main/.gitignore).
We will discuss this project and gradle in a later unit. You are welcome
to use the linked example as a .gitignore file, but I would encourage
you to delete lines 1-3, as ignoring Excel files is unique to that project.

Here we are telling git to never commit the folders `build` or `.gradle`. This
is because we only want source code on our remote repository. We do
not want to include compiled files, as compiled files are much larger, and
unnecessary to upload and download, as we will build the compiled files
locally on our workstations.

We also want to ignore local settings files like `.classpath` (which is used
by Eclipse) and `.idea/workspace.xml` (IntelliJ), as these files tell our 
IDEs things like where to find the JDK and JRE on our computer, or how
our IDE is configured for our personal programming. It's very
important to .gitignore these files, as where my Java installation is
on my computer will almost certainly not match your computer. If we commit
these files, then when anyone pulls, it's going to overwrite their
own local settings files and could create anomalous results. Further, these
files are not necessary for being able to build the source code, and
we want to limit our git repositories to storing only what is necessary
for building the source code locally.

**Be aware that .gitignore files are not retroactive**. .gitignore only
prevents future commits from adding a file to the repository. It will not
remove files that are already in the repository.

### Creating a new empty repository

Below are a few simple ways to create a git repository. Please note
that for in-class homework, Github Classroom with make a repository
for you. As such, you will not do these steps for the homework.

1. On Github, you can go to My Repositories, click the green "New" button,
and fill out the next page with the settings you want. If you are doing
this approach, I generally recommend creating a starting ReadMe, as it
makes the next few steps easier. You can then skip to cloning a new repo

2. When creating a new project in IntelliJ, you can check the box that says
create git repository, and it will make a local git repository. You can
then skip to "Pushing a local repo."
3. Using a terminal inside of an empty folder in your system, 
you can use `git init` to create a git repository. Then, as you add files and
changes to that folder, the local repository will track them. 

### Adding a git repo to an existing project

If you already have a project, and you want to start a repo, there's
a couple ways to do it.

1. In IntelliJ, I can click the tab that says "Version Control" in the
bottom left, then click "create git repository." When the file browser pops
up asking where you want the repository, you can simply select the same
folder you are working in. (Be aware that this creates a main branch named
"master", but you can rename it by right-clicking on name and going
to rename after your first commit).
2. Do the same `git init` as Step 3 under creating a git repository, but in the folder
containing the content you want to add to a repo. Then (after you setup
your .gitignore file), simply use
git add and git commit to add all the files in the folder to the repo.

### Cloning a new repo

**This is the first step you will do in the homework assignments.**

Cloning means downloading an existing remote repository to your local machine.
For simplicity, we're going to focus on cloning a repository from GitHub, [like
this one](https://github.com/sde-coursepack/NBAExcelTeams). Each remote
repository on GitHub has a `.git` link that is used to clone a repository.
You can find it under the Green "Code" button towards the top right
of the repository's home page.

If you are comfortable using SSH, you are welcome to use that, but
otherwise, I generally encourage starting out with the HTTPS link.
SSH can be more secure and convenient, but requires learning how to
set up an SSH key.

1. Within IntelliJ, we can open a remote repository as a project with
File -> New -> Project from Version Control. From there, click on
Github in the column to the left, and you'll be prompted to log-in
to GitHub (unless you are already logged-in in IntelliJ). If you log-in
to GitHub within IntelliJ, IntelliJ can find the repositories you have
access to, and you can simply select the Repository you want to use.
IntelliJ will then automatically download the repository to your computer.
2. First, you will need the `.git` link for the repository. Then, we can 
use that .git link as the Repository URL in "Repository URL" in IntelliJ.
From there, it works the same as option 1.
3. In a folder on your computer (I tend to use something like 
"My Documents/git/" as a location for general git projects, or
"My Documents/teaching/3140 for my examples for this class), open a terminal
and type `git init [url]` where [url] is the git link for the repository
you want to clone.

### Pushing a local repo as a new repository

Generally, the easiest way to do this is going to be in IntelliJ.
First, you can only push a repository to GitHub if it has at least
one commit. Additionally, you should ensure you commit a .gitignore
file before you commit any other files.

1. In an IntelliJ project where you have already created a local 
git repository with Version Control (see [Adding a git repo to an existing
project](https://sde-coursepack.github.io/modules/construction/Git-Basics/#adding-a-git-repo-to-an-existing-project) option 1) with at least one commit, go to Git -> GitHub -> Share
Project on GitHub. At that point, you'll be prompted to Log-in if you
are not already logged in. Then you can specify the name of your repository,
deciding whether or not it is private, then hit "Share"
2. First, create an empty repository on GitHub and get the git link. Then, in IntelliJ, with
an existing repository with at least one commit, make sure your main
branch is named "main" (if it's named "master", rename it), and then
click the green up-right pointing arrow in the top right for Push, or
go to Git->Push in the taskbar. Then, in the window that pops up click
the blue "define remote" task, and paste the .git link in the URL. Note
that you will have to login to GitHub.
