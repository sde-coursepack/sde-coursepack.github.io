# JSON

[JSON](https://json.org/) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format that is designed for human readability and writeability. 

Below is an example JSON file for college football teams from the 2022 season. I only included two conferences and three teams for space, but this helps illustrate some key advantages:

```json
